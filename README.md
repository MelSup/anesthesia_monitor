# anesthesia_monitor
New visualization proposal for vital signs monitoring in anesthesia

The project was coded in Python using Visual Studio Code (VSC).

The main file is monitor.py. To run it in VSC you first have to load the virtual environment with the following command:
source studysession/bin/activate

Then the program can be run as a web app using streamlit:
streamlit run monitor.py
